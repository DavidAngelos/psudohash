# psudohash (fork notes)

**This is a fork of [t3l3machus/psudohash](https://github.com/t3l3machus/psudohash).**

**Key differences from the original repository**  
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Added a progress bar in every step to track execution.  
‚ñ∂Ô∏èAdded options:
- **In-order joins** (`-i` / `--inorder`): join keywords only in the original order (e.g. `foo,bar,baz` ‚Üí `foo, bar, baz, foobar, foobaz, barbaz, foobarbaz`).
- **All-order combinations** (`-c` / `--combinations`): generate every ordering of each subset (e.g. `foo,bar,baz` ‚Üí `foo, bar, baz, foobar, foobaz, barfoo, ‚Ä¶, bazbarfoo`).
- **Custom separator** (`--sep <string>`): when joining words, insert this string between tokens (defaults to no separator).
- **Max combine size** (`--max-combine <N>`): limit how many raw keywords get joined together (default: 2).

**Why this fork exists**  
To improve user feedback and to allow generating mutations of keyword‚Äêconcatenations in a single run (e.g. `-w foo,bar` now produces `foo`, `bar`, and `foobar` mutations automatically).

## Purpose
Psudohash is a password list generator for orchestrating brute force attacks and cracking hashes. It imitates certain password creation patterns commonly used by humans, like substituting a word's letters with symbols or numbers (leet), using char-case variations, adding a common padding before or after the main passphrase and more. It is keyword-based and highly customizable. üé• -> [Video Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj3zjApOOGc)

## Pentesting Corporate Environments
System administrators and other employees often use a mutated version of the Company's name to set passwords (e.g. Am@z0n_2022). This is commonly the case for network devices (Wi-Fi access points, switches, routers, etc), application or even domain accounts. With the most basic options, psudohash can generate a wordlist with all possible mutations of one or multiple keywords, based on common character substitution patterns (customizable), case variations, strings commonly used as padding and more. Take a look at the following example:

## Customization
### Leet Character Substitution
The script implements the following character substitution schema. You can add/modify character substitution mappings by editing the `transformations` list in `psudohash.py` and following the data structure presented below (default):
```
transformations = [
	{'a' : ['@', '4']},
	{'b' : '8'},
	{'e' : '3'},
	{'g' : ['9', '6']},
	{'i' : ['1', '!']},
	{'o' : '0'},
	{'s' : ['$', '5']},
	{'t' : '7'}
]
```  
### Common Padding Values
When setting passwords, I believe it's pretty standard to add a sequence of characters before and/or after the main passphrase to make it "stronger". For example, one may set a password "dragon" and add a value like "!!!" or "!@#" at the end, resulting in "dragon!!!", "dragon!@#", etc. Psudohash reads such values from `common_padding_values.txt` and uses them to mutate the provided keywords by appending them before (`-cpb`) or after (`-cpa`) each generated keyword variation. You can modify it as you see fit.

### Year Values
When appending a year value to a mutated keyword, psudohash will do so by utilizing various seperators. by default, it will use the following seperators which you can modify by editing the `year_seperators` list:  
```
year_seperators = ['', '_', '-', '@']
```
For example, if the given keyword is "amazon" and option `-y 2023` was used, the output will include "amazon2023", "amazon_2023", "amazon-2023", "amazon@2023", "amazon23", "amazon_23", "amazon-23", "amazon@23".

## Installation
No special requirements. Just clone the repo and make the script executable:
```
git clone https://github.com/t3l3machus/psudohash
cd ./psudohash
chmod +x psudohash.py
```  
## Usage
```
./psudohash.py [-h] -w WORDS [-i] [-c] [--sep SEP] [--max-combine N] [-an LEVEL] [-nl LIMIT] [-y YEARS] [-ap VALUES] [-cpb] [-cpa] [-cpo] [-o FILENAME] [-q]
```
The help dialog [ -h, --help ] includes usage details and examples.

### Usage Examples

1. **No multi‚Äêword (singletons only)**  
   ```bash
   ./psudohash.py -w foo,bar,baz -cpa
   # ‚Üí foo, bar, baz
   ```

2. **In‚Äêorder joins (-i, up to 2 words by default)**  
   ```bash
   ./psudohash.py -w foo,bar,baz -i
   # ‚Üí foo, bar, baz, foobar, foobaz, barbaz
   ```

3. **All‚Äêorder combinations (-c, up to 2 words by default)**  
   ```bash
   ./psudohash.py -w foo,bar,baz -c
   # ‚Üí foo, bar, baz, foobar, foobaz, barfoo, barbaz, bazfoo, bazbar
   ```

4. **Change separator between joined words**  
   ```bash
   ./psudohash.py -w foo,bar,baz -i --sep "_"
   # ‚Üí foo, bar, baz, foo_bar, foo_baz, bar_baz
   ```

5. **Combine up to 3 words (instead of default 2)**  
   ```bash
   ./psudohash.py -w foo,bar,baz -i --max-combine 3
   # ‚Üí foo, bar, baz, foobar, foobaz, barbaz, foobarbaz
   ```

## Usage Tips
1. Combining options `--years` and `--append-numbering` with a `--numbering-limit` ‚â• last two digits of any year input, will most likely produce duplicate words because of the mutation patterns implemented by the tool. 
2. If you add custom padding values and/or modify the predefined common padding values in the source code, in combination with multiple optional parameters, there is a small chance of duplicate words occurring. psudohash includes word filtering controls but for speed's sake, those are limited.

## Individuals
When it comes to people, i think we all have (more or less) set passwords using a mutation of one or more words that mean something to us e.g., our name or wife/kid/pet/band names, sticking the year we were born at the end or maybe a super secure padding like "!@#". Well, guess what?

## Future 
I'm gathering information regarding commonly used password creation patterns to enhance the tool's capabilities.
